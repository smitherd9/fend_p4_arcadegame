# URL:
[Frogger Clone](https://smitherd9.github.io)

# Objective:
The player has been incarnated as Bernie Sanders' head and must effectively dodge streaming Donald Trump heads
to reach the cool waters of America.  The player can move one square at a time to the left, right, up or down but
cannot move off the board.
If the player collides with Donald Trump, he will yell at you and send you back to start.
If the player collects the gem, they will get a special message in the console.

# How to Load/Play the Game

To play the game either open up the "index.html" file in your browser or simply click on the [link](http://smitherd9.github.io) here or listed above.

#### A note about Google Chrome
In order to avoid Cross Origin request errors in Chrome it is recommended to use the above URL so that the sounds will load correctly.  Without using the above URL, it is possible to play in Chrome by hosting a local server using an extension for Chrome which can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) or by following the instructions for creating a simple Python server [here.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20041656/xmlhttprequest-cannot-load-file-cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-ht)  It should be noted that if you try to run a local Python server with Python 3 or above, you will need to use the command, python -m http.server [port number], for example:  python -m http.server 8080
